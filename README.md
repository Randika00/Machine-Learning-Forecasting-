## Machine-Learning-Forecasting- 🎯

These predictions can be generated through supervised learning, where algorithms learn patterns from existing data 📊, or unsupervised learning, where they discover general 
patterns in data 🔍. Machine learning (ML) 🤖 is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building computer systems that learn from data 🧠. The broad range of 
techniques ML encompasses enables software applications to improve their performance over time 📈. Machine learning is widely applicable across many industries 🌐. 
Recommendation engines, for example, are used by e-commerce 🛒, social media 📱, and news organizations 📰 to suggest content based on a customer's past behavior 🛍️.
