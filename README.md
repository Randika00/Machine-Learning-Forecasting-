## Machine-Learning-Forecasting-

These predictions can be generated through supervised learning, where algorithms learn patterns from existing data, or unsupervised learning, where they discover
general patterns in data.Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building computer systems that learn from data. The broad range of 
techniques ML encompasses enables software applications to improve their performance over time.
